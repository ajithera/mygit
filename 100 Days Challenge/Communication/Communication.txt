Trick for better communication:
1. Pause 
2. Slowdown to highlight
3. Rambling - It will make you sound unsure even you are sure. (Suites to me !)

DONT SWING BETWEEN TOPICS !
If you are discussing something on code, only discuss and talk about code until it is finished. 
Dont jump to other topics even a casual ones like "Where are you now?", "How is the weather there?","Have you seen that issue?" etc.
Anything that is not related to discussion makes you sound WEAK !

To DO :
1. Start a discussion/topic.
2. Finish the same discussion/topic.
3. Pause
4. Move onto next topic.
5 DONT JUMP BETWEEN TOPICS.
