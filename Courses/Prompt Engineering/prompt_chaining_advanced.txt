Prompt chaining techniques:
Chain-of-thought
Tree-of-thought

Chain-of-thought
Explaining the step by step resoning how llm get into the output.
Example: In maths, explain the steps how the output was derived.
We can ask llm to provide its reasoning for the output using prompts like "explain your reasoning" or "go step by step".
By this we can redirect the llm to get more desired output.

prompt --> reasoning stage1 --> reasoning stage2 --> reasoning stageN --> output

Deepseek LLM displays its reasoning steps while processing for the output.

Tree-of-thoughts
Multiple branches of reasonings happens parallal and chooses the best one for the output.

prompt   --> reasoning1 --> reasoning stage1 --> reasoning stage2 --> reasoning stageN --> output
        |
         --> reasoning2 -->  reasoning stage1 (reasoning stopped llm choose reasoning1 as best option than reasoning2)
        |
         --> reasoningN --> reasoning stage2 --> reasoning stage1 (reasoning stopped llm choose reasoning1 as best option than reasoning2)
