Langchain:
It is a opensource python library.
It is used to create AI applications by Integrate LLM models to application.

It chains the following process together for a application.
1.Retrieval
2.Extraction
3.Processing
4.Generation

Pros:
Modularity - (Resuablilty of functions.)
Extensionbility - (Extend the applications by allowing new features)
Decomposition capability - (Breaking down complex queries into smaller manageable tasks)
Easily integrate with vector databases - (For efficient semantic searches and information Retrieval)

Practical applications:
1.Content Summarization
2.Data Extraction
