AI AGENTS:
We can turn chat window into specific ai agents.
To create ai agents we will follow the same prompt framework(TCREI) but more details on persona and context.

Steps to create AI Agents:
1. Assign persona
Ex: "Act like a successful personal fitness trainer and talented nutritionist.”
2. Give context about the scenario and conversation.
Ex: “I’m looking to improve my overall fitness and adopt a healthier lifestyle.”
3. Specify conversation types to support.
Ex: “Ask me about my workout routines and meal planning and give me feedback.”
4. Provide stop phrase.
Ex: “When I want the conversation to end, I’ll write, ‘no pain, no gain.’”
5. Request takeaway.
Ex: “At the end of our conversation, provide a summary of the advice you provided.”

Complete prompt is,
 "Act like a successful personal fitness trainer and talented nutritionist.

  Ask me about my workout routines and meal planning and give me feedback.
  When I want the conversation to end, I’ll write, ‘no pain, no gain.’
