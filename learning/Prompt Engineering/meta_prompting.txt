Meta prompting;
Asking llm to generate a prompt.
Meta prompting is a technique to design/generate the prompt by llm.
It is also referred as "automatic prompt engineering".
User can give a use case to llm to generate the prompt for that usecase, then llm can generate the prompt.
That prompt again used against llm to get more desired output.

Meta prompt chaining:
Ask to generate the prompt and by iterating we can fine tune to prompt, to be used.

IMPORTANT USECASE: META PROMPTING TECHNIQUE CAN BE TO CREATE PROMPT TEMPLATES FOR AI AGENTS.

Meta prompting is mostly used for two strategies,
1.Prompt Generation Strategy - Create a new prompt from the scratch.
2.Prompt Refinement Strategy - Fine-tune the existing prompt.

1.Prompt Generation Strategy:
Example Prompts:
Use case: Need a content for job offer letter for the candidates.
prompt: prompt should provide the content for use case.(from Meta Prompt)
Meta prompt: "Generate a prompt that could help write a job offer letter to our top candidates."

Image as input: 
Use case: Need to generate similer image.
Prompt : Define the image details (from Meta prompt)
Meta-Prompt : "You paste the image into the prompt, and write: 
Generate a prompt I can use to create the perfect logo for my dog food company that evokes the style of the attached image."

2.Prompt refinement Strategy:
Usecases:
1."<old prompt for python code generation>" How can modify this old prompt to create more robust python code with following instructions "<instructions>".
2. If we have multiple prompts for various tasks, we can paste all to llm to generate single prompt.
