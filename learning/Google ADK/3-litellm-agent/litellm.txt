Litellm :

It is a centralised framework to handle all the models.

Why?
If you want to use 'OpenAI' you have to download OpenAI SDK to use and configure the GPT models.
If you want to use 'Gemini' you have to download Gemini SDK to use and configure the model.
Because of this if you want to switch between models you have to rewrite the entire code with respective to model we want to use.

This issue can solved by litellm. 
Onle library handles everything. we just need to choose the model.
It will handle everything on configure part.
